## Introduction

The book **â€œRISC-V Assembly Language Programmingâ€œ (RVALP)** is written by [John Winans](https://github.com/johnwinans), as an attempt to address the needs of those learning assembly language for the first time.  This project based on that content and make modifications to release the book in both [PDF version](#) and [website version](https://rvalp.pages.dev/).

## Modifications

- Replace the figures drawn by TikZ with the compiled `*.pdf` files.
- ...

## Getting Started

``` bash
$ make build/document   # generate PDF document
$ make build/site       # generate HTML files for website
$ make clean            # delete the auxiliary files
```
